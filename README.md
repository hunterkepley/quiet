# quiet


I was working on this game for a few months then decided I didn't wanna finish it due to it not being an interesting enough concept.

I made it using Go and the Pixel library.

To run it, download Golang [pretty easy, website is [golang.org](golang.org) and go to the src, and type `go build` or `go run *` if you're on Mac

You'll get errors of missing things, just type `go get X` to get X.

Mainly an artpiece at this point with bad a* pathfinding.
